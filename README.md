# Hello there üëã

I make stuff mostly in Vue.js and love writing fancy CSS. I also enjoy making things in tools like [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/) and [anime.js](https://animejs.com/).

You can see some of my work over at [CodePen](https://codepen.io/bloqhead).

### Why is your account so inactive lately?

I'm on a work GitHub account now that gets the majority of my attention. In an effort to avoid burnout and preserve my mental health, I've reserved coding to work hours and projects only, and have ditched all social media. If you would like to keep in contact, you can reach me on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/866917520627859457).
